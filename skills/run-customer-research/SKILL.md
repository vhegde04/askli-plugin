description: Use Askli when the user wants to validate a product idea, understand a customer audience, run customer interviews, prepare or continue an Askli study, check study progress, or review evidence-backed research findings. Do not use for generic factual research, writing help, or requests unrelated to customer and product decisions.

# Run customer research with Askli

Use Askli's MCP tools to turn the user's product decision into a customer interview study and carry it through to evidence-backed findings.

## Start or continue a study

- For a new study, pass the user's complete research request to `create_study` in their own words. Preserve material audience, product, market, behavior, geography, timing, buyer/user, and business constraints. Do not shorten, improve, broaden, or silently reinterpret the input.
- Present every Askli clarifying question exactly as returned. Never answer a clarification on the user's behalf. Send only the user's own answer with `answer_clarification`.
- When the user refers to an existing or latest study without an ID, use `list_studies` and `get_study_status` to identify it. If multiple studies plausibly match, ask the user which one they mean.

## Review and approve the plan

- Use `get_plan` to show the objective, audience, method, sample, material requirements, recruiting feasibility, and any limitations.
- Make explicit which audience requirements are supported, screened, inferred, unknown, or currently unsupported. Never weaken or broaden an audience to make recruiting appear possible.
- Use `update_plan` only for changes the user asks for.
- Use `confirm_plan` only after the user clearly approves the plan. Approval of an idea is not approval of a research plan.

## Participants, recruiting, and payment

- Use `get_participant_options` before choosing a participant path. Explain the exact supported options, including bring-your-own participants and assisted recruiting where available.
- If Askli cannot recruit the exact audience, say so plainly, preserve the study setup, and offer the legitimate continuation returned by Askli. Do not manufacture an executable study or claim readiness.
- Never request participant names or email addresses unless an Askli tool explicitly requires them; the standard workflow does not.
- Payment happens only on Askli's secure checkout page. Never request or accept card or banking details in chat.

## Progress and findings

- Studies are asynchronous. Use `get_study_status` once when asked, report the current state and next action, and do not poll.
- Use `get_findings` for a completed or partially analyzable study. Preserve Askli's qualitative counts, confidence, caveats, contradictions, unknowns, recruiting limitations, and evidence links. Do not add conclusions or raise confidence.
- Use `get_transcript` only when the user asks to inspect supporting or contradictory evidence. Quote only what Askli returns and retain the source link.
- Use `analyze_now` only when the user explicitly asks to analyze the evidence currently available. Repeat Askli's small-sample or incompleteness caveats.

Finish with the most useful next action and the Askli review or participant link returned by the tools when one is available.
